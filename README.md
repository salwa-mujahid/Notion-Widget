Hey !

Don't mind anything here, I was just trying to create Notion integrations myself instead of copy pasting other's work. 
It's a bit complicated since I don't want to show personnal infos and I can't add the integration without making this
repository public or without paying.

All these codes are generated by ChatGPT and a little bit of work here and there.
